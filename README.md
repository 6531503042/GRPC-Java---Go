## Overview
The gRPC Microservices Management System for User Management is designed to demonstrate a robust, scalable, and efficient architecture using gRPC for communication between services. This project incorporates both Java (Spring Boot) and Go (JIN framework) to provide a comprehensive example of a microservices-based user management system.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Utilizes Spring Boot to implement the microservices.
- **Go**: Utilizes the JIN framework for the Go-based microservices.
- **gRPC**: Facilitates communication between microservices, ensuring high performance and low latency.

## Features
- **User Creation**: Provides APIs to create new users with essential details such as username, email, password, and roles.
- **User Management**: Includes functionalities to update user details, delete users, and fetch user information.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implements security measures to ensure only authorized users can perform specific actions.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Demonstrates how to build, deploy, and manage microservices using both Java and Go.
- **gRPC Communication**: Showcases efficient inter-service communication using gRPC.

## Project Structure
- **Java Microservices (Spring Boot)**
  - **User Service**: Manages user-related operations such as creating, updating, and fetching user details.
  - **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and token generation.
  - **Authorization Service**: Manages user roles and permissions.

- **Go Microservices (JIN Framework)**
  - **User Service**: Implements similar functionalities as the Java-based User Service for redundancy and scalability.
  - **Authentication Service**: Provides authentication mechanisms compatible with the Java-based Authentication Service.
  - **Authorization Service**: Manages roles and permissions in sync with the Java-based Authorization Service.
